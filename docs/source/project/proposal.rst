Proposal
====================================

In this project we propose to carry out a datat intensive analysis of
the situation in the Argentina astronomical workforce regarding the
gender balance.

We make use of several tools and techniques, including:

   - hypothesis testing
   - machine learning
   - word embeddings
   - web scraping
   - statistical analysis
   - model selection and assessment

We aim at leveraging open data to produce our results, and we publish
the full stack of the data reduction and analysis pipeline so that
anyone can use the data and reproduce the results or revamp the
analysis.

This way, our results and conclusions can be revised by researchers in
the data science or gendeer studies communities.



Methods
-------

We propose the following working hypothesis: In Argentina, in the
profesional astronomical community, there is a segregation effect
in gender due to structural causes and independent of personal
choices. This segregation or gender bias leads to a noticeable
unfair availability of opportunities in the development of careers for
women and men.


Data analysis
--------------

Statistical analysis of the following aspects on the astronomy career
in Argentina:

* Gender representation in the academic career in Universities
* Gender representation in scholarships (CONICET)
* Gender representation in permanent positions (CIC, CONICET)
* Gender differences in scientific production metrics
* Gender differences in the academic performance in Universities
